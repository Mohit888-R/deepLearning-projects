# Deep Learning Projects Detailed Explaination

### [1. Image Captioning With Attention Mechanism](https://github.com/Mohit888-R/deepLearning-projects/blob/main/project1-image-captioning-with-attention-mechanism/REAME.md) : Develop an image captioning system using deep learning with attention mechanisms to generate descriptive captions focusing on relevant image parts.
### [2. Sentiment Analysis For Product Reviews](https://github.com/Mohit888-R/deepLearning-projects/blob/main/project2-sentiment-analysis-for-product-reviews/README.md) : Create a sentiment analysis model using deep learning to classify product reviews as positive or negative, helping businesses gauge customer feedback.
### [3. Music Generation With Variaitional Autoencoders](https://github.com/Mohit888-R/deepLearning-projects/blob/main/project3-Music-Generation-with-variaitional-autoencoders/README.md) : Implement a music generation system using VAEs to learn latent music representations and generate new compositions.
### [4. Human Pose Estimation](https://github.com/Mohit888-R/deepLearning-projects/blob/main/project4-human-pose-estimation/README.md) : Build a deep learning model to detect and locate key body joints in images or videos, enabling accurate real-time human pose estimation.
### [5. Stock Market Prediction](https://github.com/Mohit888-R/deepLearning-projects/blob/main/project5-Stock-market-prediction/README.md) : Develop a stock market prediction model using RNNs to analyze historical data and forecast future price movements, aiding in investment decision-making.
