#### Image captioning with attention mechanism is a fascinating deep learning project that combines computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) to generate descriptive captions for images. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on specific regions of the image while generating captions, making the captions more accurate and contextually relevant.

##### Below explained how to implement an image captioning system with an attention mechanism : 
### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing : 

<p>You need a dataset that contain images and captions. We can use Microsoft COCO(Common Objects in Context), Flickr8k or Flickr30k. Those datasets consist of images from variouse categories, each paired with multiple human-generated captions.
Preprocessing the Images:
Before feeding images into the deep learning model, it's essential to preprocess them to ensure consistency and reduce computational overhead. The steps for image preprocessing are as follows:

<b>Load Images</b>: Use an image loading library like OpenCV or Pillow to read the images from the dataset.

<b>Resize Images</b>: Since images in the dataset can have different sizes, resize them to a uniform size (e.g., 224x224 or 299x299) to ensure consistency during training and to fit the model's input requirements.

<b>Normalize Pixel Values</b>: Scale the pixel values of the images to a common range (usually [0, 1]) by dividing each pixel value by the maximum possible value (255 for 8-bit images).

<b>Tokenization and Creating Vocabulary </b>:
To process the captions, you need to tokenize them, convert words into numerical tokens, and build a vocabulary. Tokenization involves splitting each caption into individual words or subwords. For example, the sentence "A cute dog is running" can be tokenized into [A, cute, dog, is, running].

<b>Tokenization</b>: Use a natural language processing library like NLTK or spaCy to tokenize the captions. You may choose to lowercase the words to ensure case insensitivity.

<b>Word-to-Index Mapping</b>: Assign a unique index (integer) to each word in the vocabulary. This mapping is crucial for converting words into numerical representations during model training.

<b>Padding</b>: To create batches of input data, ensure that all captions have the same length. If a caption is shorter than the maximum length, pad it with a special token (e.g., <PAD>) to match the maximum length.

For example, if the maximum caption length is 15 words, and a caption has only 10 words, the padding process will add 5 <PAD> tokens at the end of the caption.

The final result is a vocabulary that contains a list of words, a word-to-index mapping, and a list of tokenized captions with padding applied. These preprocessed data will serve as input to the image captioning model during training and inference.

<p><b>Technology </b> : Python</p>
<p><b>Libraries </b> : NumPy, OpenCV, NLTK</p>
<p>Preprocess the images and text data. Resize the images to a standard size, convert them to arrays using OpenCV, and tokenize the captions using NLTK for further processing.
